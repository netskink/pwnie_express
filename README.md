coding exercise for interview

These are the choices given to me for the interview exercise.  I did the give change problem.  These are the additonal options. Maybe I will code these later.

CAESAR CIPHER 
Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC". This simple "monoalphabetic substitution cipher" provides almost no security, because an attacker who has the encoded message can either use frequency analysis to guess the key, or just try all 25 keys.
 
SIEVE OF ERATOSTHENES 
The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all of the smaller primes (below 10 million or so).

INVERTED INDEX
An Inverted Index is a data structure used to create full text search. Given a set of text files (or an array of strings), implement a program to create an inverted index. Optionally, create a user interface to do a search using that inverted index which returns a list of files that contain the query term / terms. The search index can be in memory.
